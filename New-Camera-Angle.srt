1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,233
okay so Friday had a lesson

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,100
and I tried to install that thing

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,500
but it didn't work um

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,800
so I'm gonna put a clip

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,566
here of how that lesson went or what the

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,033
what the camera shot was like

7
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,766
it was uh way

8
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,166
way over exposed

9
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,600
uh the light

10
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,900
coming out the windscreen was literally like this

11
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,500
you can't see anything on the road

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,033
so there's no point it

13
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,666
being behind

14
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,566
so I was trying to basically see us

15
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:28,466
and see the road in front um

16
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,933
but you could basically just see us

17
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:30,700
and everything else out

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,300
the windshield was just a bright light

19
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,333
it was a sunny day

20
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,266
but I feel like there's more to do with my camera

21
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,200
you know uh

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,033
exposure and something to do some settings on the GoPro

23
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,333
and also where it was pointing was like mainly at us

24
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,366
rather than like focusing on the outside

25
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:49,366
try and find a good position for the GoPro

26
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,433
so I'm kind of thinking right here

27
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,000
looking at the driver

28
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,833
this might be a good place but uh

29
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,000
you can see that if I edit it this

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,766
this is what it looks like so

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,533
here so I'm thinking it gets the driver

32
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,533
the learner

33
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:16,300
maybe a bit of me but that's not really that important

34
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:19,833
now I need to get the double sticky tape thing

35
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:23,033
stick it on and hopefully we have a winner this angle

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,866
okay another dilemma is we've got this angle

37
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:39,066
what I found from here is that this is a bit like

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
supposed to be sticky here

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,500
so I feel like the weight pulls on this maybe

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,766
and it might fall off

41
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,933
there's less weight going down on it maybe

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,333
there's a bit more grip

43
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:54,733
but is that

44
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,266
I don't know

45
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,866
it's a weird angle I don't know

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,000
I feel like I kinda like this

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,066
and that sees the whole driver's experience

48
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,833
what they see high height as well

49
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,766
let's go I wanna do both

50
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,766
oh no I can't um

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,900
here try without the super wide

52
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,466
*squeal in terror*

53
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,666
how that

54
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,066
I've committed squeeze

55
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,633
no

56
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,633
I've lost all the stick

57
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:08,066
huh right how do I stick that on there duct tape

58
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,533
hold on

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,533
oh rubbish whole thing waste of time

60
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,333
how did I get it on there

61
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:22,833
okay have an idea

62
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:30,466
I've got a head

63
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,400
that might work

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,100
okay new idea

65
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:49,366
head strap

66
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,733
that is actually decent

67
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,700
so that's basically exactly where I wanted it

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,433
now that is something else

69
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,200
bit shaky might be decent

70
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,200
how did that sound

71
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:16,200
so find out in the footage afterwards

72
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,233
alright let's go for a drive

73
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:24,200
so I thought this is more IGTV

74
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,866
don't know what that is

75
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,900
until just then I thought everything was real

76
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,533
but now thinking about it

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,233
I have seen an app called IGTV

78
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:36,500
which I think is for watching longer videos

79
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,433
so maybe this is where this will be

80
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,700
so yeah

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,600
alright so we're chopping and changing in between

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,333
little bits of light

83
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,400
which is good

84
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:00,966
I'm actually so excited to see how this goes over bumps

85
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,800
that's probably gonna shake a bit

86
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,233
alright let's see how it goes
